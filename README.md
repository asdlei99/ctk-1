Compiler Toolkit
================
Compiler Toolkit (CTK) is an idea - a single-file, public domain compiler library and toolchain.

The project is developed across multiple files, but I'm planning on having each release be amalgamated into
a single .h file.

This doesn't do anything useful at the moment, but the ultimate plan is something kind of like LLVM, but not
as big and cumbersome. Don't expect anything usful out of this for a quite some time.

More soon(-ish).
